#Word Calculator

By Diane Douglas

*An arithmetic program which calculates the answers to problems phrased in english.*

**For Example:**

What is 2 plus 2?
What is 3 plus 2 to the power of 3?
What is 5 minus 4 divided by 2?
What is 4 to the 2nd power?
What is 2 minus minus 6? 

Just use actual digits like '2' instead of spelling them out like 'two' and phrase your input as a question. 
Feel free to ask several at once!
